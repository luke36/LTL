- [DONE] nTempral() is silly. We should at least count identical atoms once.
- Better, we should only compute their transitions once, since they are the
  same after all. But it's cheap anyway.
- Support operation between DynBitset of different sizes. Then we do not need
  the above.
- Use the maximal atom index in a formula, rather than the number of all atoms.
- Do not copy the entire transition, but just return a pointer when possible.
